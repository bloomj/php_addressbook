PHP Address book
===============

Overview
-------------------------
This is simple address book application that is built from a typical LAMP stack.

A few of my coworkers expressed interest in learning some basics of software engineering and methodologies.  A coworker of
mine ([oweneustice](https://github.com/oweneustice)) volunteered to put together a sample tutorial to follow through on building software on a LAMP stack.  Given my lack
of experience with PHP and developing on a Linux platform, I've decided to join in on the fun.

The project serves as a starting point to refresh memory of or learn about new/existing languages, frameworks, design patterns, etc.

Currently demonstrates
-------------------------
* Eclipse
* PHP
* Apache
* MySQL
  
TODO
-------------------------
* Update/Complete unit tests, research PHPUnit and Selenium plugins
* Update/Complete documentation

Notes
-------------------------
* Requirements for the address book functionality are based off the artifacts provided [here](http://www.cs.gordon.edu/courses/cs211/AddressBookExample/).
* Setup of the LAMP environment and design follows [this article](https://hackpad.com/Part-1-Virtual-Development-Environment-Wg5EtzZA9o2) up until my eventual divergence.
